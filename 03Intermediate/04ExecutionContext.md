Window context is tied majorly with the browser
Learn more about JS Context because it is the basics.
Two types of major contexts are available to us and they are 1- Global context and 2 - the context that is running right now
There is also an execution context which kicks in when an execution is needed like a function or a console log.
Execution context stacks upon Global context just like a memory stack and goes away once an execution is done.
There are around 4 to 5 features that Execution context provides us with such as - Variable Object, Scope chain and this keyword
Two rules of Execution Context - 

1. Function declarations are scanned and made available.
2. Variable declarations are scanned and made undefined.
